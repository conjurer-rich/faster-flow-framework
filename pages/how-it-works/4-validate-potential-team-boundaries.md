## Validate Boundaries with Independent Service Heuristics

Finding a potential boundary is just the start. We guide teams through a lightweight, collaborative validation process using **Independent Service Heuristics**, which:

- Help assess whether a proposed boundary supports autonomous delivery
- Highlight dependencies or coupling that may require attention
- Encourage **group consensus** around what makes a boundary strong and sustainable

This process **maximizes confidence** in the proposed structure, reducing the risk of reorganizing around weak or unstable divisions.

### Why This Matters

Without careful validation, even well-intended restructures can introduce new problems. By grounding boundary changes in **real user needs** and **collaborative heuristics**, your teams are more likely to:

- Deliver independently and sustainably
- Avoid coordination overload
- Adapt to change without constant rework
