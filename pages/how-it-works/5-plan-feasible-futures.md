## Align Strategy with Structure—One Step at a Time

Once new boundaries have been proposed and validated, the question becomes: what does a better future look like, and how do we get there without disruption?

The Faster Flow Framework helps organizations evaluate **feasible futures**—structural options that support improved value flow while remaining grounded in current capabilities, constraints, and strategic goals.

### Start with Strategic Clarity

We begin by aligning on what matters most. Using tools like **Core Domain Charts** and **Market Evolution Analysis**, we:

- **Minimize misalignment** between strategic priorities and operational structures
- Identify **critical capabilities** and where differentiation or commoditization is likely
- Clarify where to **invest, divest, or delegate** based on long-term impact

This alignment ensures that future structures support—not contradict—your organization's direction.

### Explore Futures with Team Interaction Modelling

With strategic clarity in place, we use **Team Interaction Modelling** to:

- Evaluate potential structural futures in context of delivery needs
- Identify handoffs, dependencies, and feedback loops that need redesign
- Explore **incremental steps** that enable safe-to-try evolution without large-scale disruption

These collaborative sessions help teams visualize how work would flow in the future—and how to move toward it without stalling current delivery.

### Why This Matters

Too often, organizations rush to a new structure without thinking through how to get there—or whether it actually supports strategic intent.

By combining strategic tools with interaction modeling, you gain:

- A **clearer picture** of your possible futures
- **Confidence in your path** to evolve structure over time
- A shared vision of how flow and alignment can improve together
