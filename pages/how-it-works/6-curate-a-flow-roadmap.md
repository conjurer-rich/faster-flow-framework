## Turn insights into action with a flow roadmap

With strategic alignment, validated boundaries, and feasible futures in view, the final step is to bring it all together in a practical, navigable plan.

The **Flow Roadmap** is the connective tissue between vision and execution. It helps your organization take an iterative, low-risk approach to structural evolution—while staying focused on improving flow.

### Capture key decisions with Flow Decision Records

At the heart of the roadmap is a series of **Flow Decision Records (FDRs)**. Each record documents a specific decision, including:

- The flow-related challenge or opportunity it addresses
- The teams or services impacted
- Dependencies or enabling changes required
- The rationale behind the decision and how it supports strategic alignment

FDRs are designed to **maximize clarity and utility**—not just for current leaders, but for those who come later. They form a traceable, evolving narrative of how and why flow-informed changes were made.

### Organize change with Now / Next / Later planning

We align decisions along a **Now / Next / Later** structure, making it easy to:

- Sequence efforts based on urgency, feasibility, and strategic value
- Identify and address dependencies between decisions
- Create space for **We can if...** thinking to overcome early-stage blockers or path dependencies

This structure provides **a practical, visual approach** to managing change while keeping flow at the center.

### Why this matters

Without a clear and flexible roadmap, even the best insights get lost—or worse, stall in endless debate. The Flow Roadmap ensures that insights turn into coordinated action by:

- Making decisions visible, traceable, and reusable
- Providing a shared reference point for cross-team alignment
- Minimizing risk in the early stages of change

Whether you're implementing small shifts or major reconfigurations, the Flow Roadmap keeps your organization moving forward—intentionally, iteratively, and in flow.
