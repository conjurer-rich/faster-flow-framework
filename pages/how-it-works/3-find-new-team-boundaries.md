## Evolve Structure Around Real Needs, Not Assumptions

Once you've identified where flow is blocked, the next challenge is deciding how to evolve your organization to support faster, smoother delivery. This means finding and validating team and service boundaries that align with real user needs—not legacy structures or internal silos.

The Faster Flow Framework provides a collaborative, systems-aware approach to discovering and testing better boundaries, grounded in how value actually flows through your organization.

### Discover New Team Boundaries with Proven Techniques

We use a combination of analytical and discovery methods to uncover where new boundaries want to emerge:

- **User Needs Mapping** highlights disconnects between current structures and the needs they aim to serve
- **Event Storming** uncovers key domain events, responsibilities, and handoffs across your system
- **Fracture Planes Exploration** helps expose natural separation points based on volatility, cadence, security, and more

These methods **minimize the time** it takes to uncover meaningful, domain-aligned boundaries—without falling into the trap of purely top-down restructuring.
