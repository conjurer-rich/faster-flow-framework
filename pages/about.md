## Our mission

The Faster Flow Framework was created to help organizations systematically improve their value delivery by making data-driven decisions about team structures and boundaries. We believe that better flow leads to better outcomes for organizations, teams, and individuals.

## Our story

The framework emerged from years of experience helping organizations optimize their structures and processes. We noticed that many organizations struggled with:

- Unclear team boundaries
- Inefficient value delivery
- Risky organizational changes
- Misaligned strategy and structure

This led us to develop a systematic approach that combines proven methodologies with practical tools and templates.
